class Inference:

        """
        Initialize the Inference class with the input data.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        data : dict
            The input data containing the graphical model details, such as variables, cliques, potentials, and k value.
        
        What to do here:
        ----------------
        - Parse the input data and store necessary attributes (e.g., variables, cliques, potentials, k value).
        - Initialize any data structures required for triangulation, junction tree creation, and message passing.
        
        Refer to the sample test case for the structure of the input data.

        """
        Triangulate the undirected graph and extract the maximal cliques.
        
        What to do here:
        ----------------
        - Implement the triangulation algorithm to make the graph chordal.
        - Extract the maximal cliques from the triangulated graph.
        - Store the cliques for later use in junction tree creation.

        Refer to the problem statement for details on triangulation and clique extraction.

    def get_junction_tree(self):
        """
        Construct the junction tree from the maximal cliques.
        
        What to do here:
        ----------------
        - Create a junction tree using the maximal cliques obtained from the triangulated graph.
        - Ensure the junction tree satisfies the running intersection property.
        - Store the junction tree for later use in message passing.

        """
        Assign potentials to the cliques in the junction tree.
        
        What to do here:
        ----------------
        - Map the given potentials (from the input data) to the corresponding cliques in the junction tree.
        - Ensure the potentials are correctly associated with the cliques for message passing.
        
        Refer to the sample test case for how potentials are associated with cliques.

        ----------------
        - Implement the message passing algorithm to compute the partition function (Z value).
        - The Z value is the normalization constant for the probability distribution.
        
        Refer to the problem statement for details on computing the partition function.

    def compute_marginals(self):
        """
        Compute the marginal probabilities for all variables in the graphical model.
        
        What to do here:
        ----------------
        - Use the message passing algorithm to compute the marginal probabilities for each variable.
        - Return the marginals as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the probabilities for a variable.
